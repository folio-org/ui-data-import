## Introduction

Application for Data Import functionality

## Prerequisites

In order to view and log into the platform being served up, a suitable Okapi backend will need to be running. The [Folio testing-backend](https://app.vagrantup.com/folio/boxes/testing-backend) Vagrant box should work if your app does not yet have its own backend module.

## Run your new app

Run the following from the ui-data-import directory to serve your new app using a development server:
```
stripes serve
```
If you would like to include this compoenent into platform, please add
```
"@folio/data-import": "../ui-data-import"
```
to `.stripesclirc` file.
And
```
'@folio/data-import': {}
```
to `stripes.config.js` file.

Note: When serving up a newly created app that does not have its own backend permissions established, pass the `--hasAllPerms` option to display the app in the UI navigation. For example:
```
stripes serve --hasAllPerms
```

To specify your own tenant ID or to use an Okapi instance other than http://localhost:9130, pass the `--okapi` and `--tenant` options.
```
stripes serve --okapi http://my-okapi.example.com:9130 --tenant my-tenant-id
```
